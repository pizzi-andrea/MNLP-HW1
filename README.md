Multiclass Classification of Cultural Items


## The task

The task is to develop an automatic classifier, that classifies items using our taxonomy (C.A, C.R, C.E)

- **Cultural Agnostic Item**: the item is commonly known/used worldwide and no culture claims the item

- **Cultural Representative Item**: the item is originated in a culture and/or claimed by a culture as their own, but other cultures know/use it or have similar items

- **Cultural Exclusive Item**: the item is known/used only in a specific culture and it is claimed by that culture

We want to use two different methods:

- LM-based method
- not LM-based
